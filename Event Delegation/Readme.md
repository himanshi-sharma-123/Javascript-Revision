## EVENT DELEGATION

Event Delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element instead of individual child elements. It allows handling events efficiently, expecially for dynamically added elements.

## BENEFITS

1 Memory :- We need to attach only one event handler
2 Writing less code
2 DOM Manipulation

## LIMITATION

1 All events are not bubbled up ex- blur , focus etc.
